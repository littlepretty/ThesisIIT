\section{Summary of One-Big-Switch Abstraction}
\label{OBS:Sec:Conclusion}

We present a three-step model abstraction technique to transform an SDN-based network to
an ``one-big-switch'' based network without losing the forwarding behavior as
defined by the OpenFlow rules in the network devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that the big-switch abstraction correctly models
the end-to-end forwarding logic of the original SDN network,
and the abstracted model significantly saves the experiment running time and system resources.
The ultimate goal of the one-big-switch abstraction is to enhance simulation and emulation scalability while preserving packet-level fidelity.
This paper mainly focuses on the end-to-end for- warding logic equivalence,
and we will investigate end-to-end performance equivalence, such as latency and packet drop in the future.
