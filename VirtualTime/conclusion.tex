\Section{Summary of Virtual Time System}
\label{VT:Sec:Conclusion}

In conclusion, we present a Linux-container-based virtual time system and integrated it to a widely used SDN emulator, Mininet.
The lightweight system uses a time-dilation-based design to offer virtual time to the containers,
as well as the applications running inside the containers with no code modification.
Experimental results show the promising fidelity and scalability improvement of Mininet with virtual time,
particularly for high workload network scenarios. We have also used the platform to precisely
evaluate the limitations of the ECMP routing in a realistic data center network with the results being validated by a physical testbed.
Future works include the investigation of other effective control algorithms to further improve the adaptive TDF scheduler,
and the integration to network simulators based on virtual time for large-scale network analysis.
