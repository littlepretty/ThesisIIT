As modern computer networking technologies get deeply integrated into people's everyday lives,
it is critical to ensure their continued successful operations.
Moreover, it is no longer optional to protect them against cyber-attacks and cyber failures.
Successful operation of modern networked computer systems are not by coincidence or luck.
Network operators today heavily rely on realistic and scalable testing platforms to
evaluate the functionality and the performance of their communication infrastructures, protocols as well as application design.

Occurred attacks and failures should be thoroughly studied and the protection mechanism should be carefully implemented to ensure safe and trusted communication of information.
Reproducing and analyzing the attacks happened in the real world and, more importantly, practicing, as well as evaluating, the countermeasures is critical but becomes
enormously difficult.
This calls for a high-fidelity and scalable virtually simulated or emulated testbed.

Meanwhile, the network today in many domains and settings, is evolving toward the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm.
SDN promises centralized and rapid network provisioning, holistic management, low operational cost, and improved network visibility.
Multiple SDN simulation and emulation platforms have helped to expedite the adoption of many emerging SDN-based applications to production systems.
However, all of those virtual simulation or emulation testbeds are highly coupled with the underlying available physical hardware resources.
As the result, their correctness will be corrupted, their scalability limited, and their fidelity compromised,
especially exposed under the common large-scale network settings.
Under the central theme of securing SDN-enabled large-scale networks using a high-fidelity and scalable testing system,
my research work has the following four streams.

\input{VirtualTime/intro}
\input{OneBigSwitch/intro}
\input{CompareDL/intro}
\input{Magic/intro}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows.
Chapter~\ref{Cpt:RelatedWorks} briefly reviews the related work for each topic.
Then Chapter~\ref{Cpt:VTS}--~\ref{Cpt:DLMC} discusses the aforementioned works in details in the following order:
introducing motivation, describing system design, providing implementation details,
conducting expermimental evaluation, and finally summarizing this stream of work.
Chapter~\ref{Cpt:Conclusion} concludes the thesis with future works.
