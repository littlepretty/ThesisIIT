Successful operation of modern networked computer systems are not by coincidence or luck.
Network operators heavily relies on the realistic and scalable testing platforms to
evaluate the functionality and the performance of their communication infrastructures and protocols.
Moreover, as the successfully and widely deployed computer networking technology gets deeply integrated into people's everyday lives,
it is no longer optional to protect network against cyber-attacks.
Occurred attacks should be thoroughly studied and its defense carefully implemented to ensure safe and trusted communication of information.
Replaying the attacks happened in real world and, more importantly, practicing, as well as evaluating, the countermeasures become 
enormously difficult if without a virtually simulated or emulated testbed.
Meanwhile, the network today in many domains and settings, are evolving toward the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm.
SDN promises centralized and rapid network provisioning, holistic management, low operational cost, and improved network visibility.
Multiple SDN simulation and emulation platforms have help expedite the adoption of many emerging SDN-based applications to production systems.
However, all of those virtual simulation or emulation testbeds are highly coupled with the underlying available physical hardware resources.
As the result, their correctness will be corrupted, their scalability limited, and their fidelity compromised,
especially exposed under the common large-scale network settings.
Under the centre theme of securing SDN-enabled large-scale network using high-fidelity and scalable testing system, our research work has four streams.

\input{VirtualTime/intro}
\input{OneBigSwitch/intro}
\input{CompareDL/intro}
\input{Magic/intro}

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows.
Chapter~\ref{Cpt:RelatedWorks} briefly review the related works for each of the four topics.
Then Chapter~\ref{Cpt:VTS}--~\ref{Cpt:DLMC} discuss aforementioned systems respectively in details,
typically in the order of: introducing motivation, describing system design, providing implementation details if necessary,
then conducting expermimental evaluation, and finally summarizing this stream of work.
Chapter~\ref{Cpt:Conclusion} concludes our entire works.
