Realistic and scalable testing platforms for computer network system are critical for multiple application domains.
Network operators heavily relies on them to evaluate the functionality and the performance of their communication infrastructures and protocols.
Replaying the cyber-attacks happened in real world and, more importantly, practicing, as well as evaluating, the countermeasures become 
enormously difficult if without a virtually simulated or emulated testbed.
Meanwhile, the network today in many domains and settings, are evolving toward the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm.
Multiple SDN simulation and emulation platforms have help expedite the adoption of many emerging SDN-based applications to production systems.
However, all of those virtual simulation or emulation testbeds are highly coupled with the underlying available physical hardware resources.
As the result, their correctness will be corrupted, their scalability limited, and their fidelity compromised,
especially exposed under the common large-scale network settings.
Under the centre theme of securing SDN-enabled large-scale network using high-fidelity and scalable testing system, our research work has three streams.

Linux-container-based network emulation (LCNE) combines many desired features of software simulators and physical testbeds.
Therefore, first we ask not what LCNE can do for computer network -- ask what we can do for LCNE.
Specifically, we address one of the key issues of this attractive methodology.
An ordinary Linux-container based SDN emulator uses the system clock across all the containers even if a container is not being scheduled to run.
This leads to the issue of temporal fidelity, especially with high workloads.
Virtual time sheds the light on this issue by precisely scaling the time of interactions between containers and physical devices.
We develope a lightweight Linux-container-based virtual time system and integrate the system to Mininet.
Except for enhancing Minint's fidelity and scalability,
our virtual time system is also a good alternative for the synchronization problem in hybrid simulation and emulation.

Second, we ask not what simulation will do for SDN-enabled network, but ask what the centralized paradigm can do for the methodology that simulates itself.
Following this idea, we present a model abstraction technique that effectively transforms
the network devices in an SDN-based network to one virtualized switch model.
While significantly reducing the model execution time and enabling the real-time simulation capability,
our abstracted model also preserves the end-to-end forwarding behavior of the original network.

Recently, deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art results across a range of hard problem spaces,
such as image classification and natural language processing,
Therefore, we ask what together simulation/emulation testing system and deep learning technology can do for network security.
Our answer is anomaly detection based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), the essential network-architecture-agnostic security building-blocks.
We study the feasibility of off-line deep learning based NIDS by constructing the detection engine with multiple advanced deep learning models.
Using our TensorFlow-based deep learning library NetLearner, we conduct a quantitative and comparative evaluation of those models.
