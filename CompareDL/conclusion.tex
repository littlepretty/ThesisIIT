\section{Summary}
We study cutting-edge deep learning models to the design of network intrusion detection systems.
%First, we briefly discuss general deep learning methodology and its potential implication on the network intrusion detection problem.
%Then we describe a set of promising deep learning models in concisely mathematical languages.
With the help of our open-source Tensorflow-based deep learning library NetLearner,
we perform a comparative evaluation of those models on two network intrusion detection tasks using the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets.
Preliminary experimental results show that for the NSL-KDD task, sparse autoencoder achieves accuracy similar to the existing machine learning solutions;
for the UNSW-NB15 dataset, deep neural network models with greater generalization capability achieve better accuracy than SVM based solutions.
